# DL/MLSE Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio showcases real-world projects across **machine learning**, **data engineering**, **computer vision**, **cybersecurity**, and **generative AI**. These projects are built with **production-level practices**, using public or synthetic datasets to simulate real-world behavior while protecting sensitive data.

Each project demonstrates applied experience in developing end-to-end solutions‚Äîranging from model development to deployment and data orchestration.

All code and pipelines were created by **Bianca Yeseo Kim**, a Data Scientist and ML Engineer based in NYC.
