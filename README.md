## Data Scientist | Production ML & Applied AI Systems

I design machine learning and data systems that operate under real-world constraints — limited labels, noisy data, latency bottlenecks, and high-dimensional feature spaces.

My work focuses on structuring ambiguous problems, engineering reliable data pipelines, and selecting modeling strategies based on trade-offs rather than tool preference.

## Projects Overview
### AD  – Enterprise Anomaly Detection  
Enterprise security systems generate massive event logs with very few labeled threats. Manual review leads to high false positives and operational inefficiency.

**Approach**  
- Engineered synthetic insider threat data to simulate realistic attack patterns  
- Combined Isolation Forest (unsupervised anomaly scoring) with XGBoost (supervised classification) to handle sparse labels  
- Structured feature pipelines for log aggregation and normalization  
- Evaluated precision-recall trade-offs to reduce false positive burden  

**Skills Demonstrated**  
Anomaly detection under uncertainty, ensemble modeling, feature engineering, operational trade-off analysis<br>      
*Tech stack:* XGBoost, Isolation Forest, PyCaret
