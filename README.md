# Portfolio Overview

This portfolio highlights projects across machine learning, data engineering, computer vision, cybersecurity, and generative AI. It includes public datasets, Kaggle challenges, simulations, and real-world use cases â€” all designed to reflect practical, production-quality work.


** All scripts are generated from Bianca Yeseo Kim and all datasets in this project are either public or synthetic, generated to simulate real-world behavior to prevent exposing proprietary data.



## > Projects

###  **SmartStream**  
**User Behavior Based Product**  
Modular analytics and ML pipelines simulating user behavior across entertainment, fitness, music, and ride-sharing platforms. Includes mood classification, trip prediction, churn modeling, and content recommendations.

###  **PulseAI** 
**Real-Time Behavioral Intelligence Engine**  
Streaming pipeline for real-time session modeling, churn detection, and intelligent API delivery across digital services.

###  **MobilityAI**
**Ridership Intelligence**  
Geospatial clustering and trip prediction using NYC taxi data, built to model surge pricing and demand-supply imbalance.

###  **SyncFit**  (WIP)
**Fitness + Wearable Simulation**  
Behavioral engagement and churn analytics platform simulating wearable fitness logs and personalized class recommendations.

###  **BioSec**  
**Biotech Security / Insider Threats**  
Inspired by real cybersecurity experience, this project simulates access logs and insider threats in bioinformatics infrastructure using LSTM anomaly detection and PyCaret.

###  **AD**  (WIP)
**Anomaly Detection for Cybersecurity**  
Built on ensemble learning and supervised/ unsupervised models for anomaly classification in enterprise-level event logs.

###  **ASAPP**  
**LLM-based Customer Service Assistant**  
Prototype for a generative AI-powered chatbot trained to anticipate agent responses and suggest next actions using prompt-tuned transformer models.

###  **Dscvr.ai**  (WIP)
**GenAI Writing Accelerator**  
Award-winning hackathon project for an AI-powered research and writing assistant. Built with OpenAI and React, focused on workflow automation.

###  **EY**  
**Urban Heat Island Prediction**  
Spatial regression model using NYC land temperature and zoning data to predict urban heat islands, developed for EY's Data Challenge.

###  **NYBG**  
**Botanical Image Classification**  
Computer vision project from Kaggle x Break Through Tech AI x NY Botanical Garden competition. Trained CNNs on a large botanical species image set.
