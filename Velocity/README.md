# Overview
The AI-powered platform accelerates your go-to-market journey by automating customer discovery, validation, and sales execution. Instead of spending 6+ months on manual research, cold outreach, and testing assumptions, founders can now:

# Target Users
- Primary ICP: Early-stage Founders, Solo Entrepreneurs, Startup Co-founders
- These are primary decision-makers responsible for customer acquisition, product validation, and GTM strategy execution who collaborate with co-founders, potential customers, design partners, and investors.

# The Problem
Current founder workflows are highly inefficient:

* 20+ hours/week wasted on manual prospect research instead of building product
* Cold outreach response rates stuck at 2–5%, making growth painfully slow
* Validation paralysis – unclear which assumptions to prioritize or how to design effective experiments
* Inconsistent process – no unified methodology, every test feels like reinventing the wheel
* Slow iteration cycles – takes 2–4 weeks to validate even simple hypotheses, delaying pivots and progress

# The Solution
Automated AI Workflow

* Automated Research: AI agents identify and shortlist top qualified prospects across multiple platforms
* Personalized Outreach: AI generates custom messages referencing specific pain points and problem statements
* Validation Framework: AI executes surveys to systematically test and validate key business assumptions
* Insights Synthesis: AI applies pattern recognition to customer feedback to uncover actionable insights
* GTM Strategy: AI produces go-to-market plans grounded in validated customer insights


Built with scalestack, Claude, and Anthropic Console
